My name is Aduramimo Oludare, I am an aspiring web developer.
This is a simple to-do app i created as an entry for the Co-Creation Hub Graduate Programme.

The todoapp.html is the basic structure of the entire app, and it provides us with the text and various buttons needed.
I inputted some dummy activities that would be replaced upon user input.

todocss.css provides styling for the various elements I created while the todo.js provides some JavaScript Interaction, for example,
claering the text box immediately the user has added a task.
